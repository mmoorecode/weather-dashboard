Notes for potential future additions to this project:

- Provide option to connect/disconnect from the arduino via a socket event
emitted from the client side
- Have the server scan for the arduino connection rather than manually
inputting it each time.
- Add a Config tab for changing the settings for the arduino connection
(i.e. have a text box where the user can enter the port to connect to the arduino,
make the baud rate configurable via a numeric dropdown)
- Move location data into an overarching application context so global data is easier
to propagate throughout the components
- Get more location data and move it from the JSON file into a db where it can be queried
rather than loaded all at once at runtime
- Add more options for viewing the data (i.e. add option to view data for a given timespan,
add dropdown to change the interval/count of tick marks on the x axis)
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Add ability to append location data to the table
- Move arduino/websocket connection handling into its own utility class
- Improve styling for the sensor availability checkbox under the Locations tab
